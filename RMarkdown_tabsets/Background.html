Invasive species are a global problem, causing widespread economic and ecological impacts (Vilà et al. 2011). In forest ecosystems alone, invasive species can reduce native diversity (Hartman and McCarthy 2008, Vilà et al. 2011, Waller et al. 2016), alter forest structure (Hartman and McCarthy 2008), suppress tree regeneration (Oswalt et al. 2007, Boyce 2009), alter nutrient cycling (Ehrenfeld et al. 2001) and modify disturbance regimes (D'Antonio and Vitousek 1992). Invasive plants can also negatively impact ecosystem services and human health (Pejchar and Mooney 2009). For example, invasive shrub thickets have been linked to increased densities of black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) and elevated exposure of humans to tick-borne illnesses (Elias et al. 2006, Ward and Williams 2010).

Protected areas are not immune to invasive species (Rooney et al. 2004, Abella 2014). In fact, invasive plants are a major focus of many land management agencies and managers of protected areas (Hulme 2006, Pearson et al. 2009). However, given limited resources, much of the focus is on managing invasive populations with less attention to monitoring, particularly monitoring beyond the scale of specific treatment areas and/or individual species (Blossey 1999, Hulme 2006). As a result, much of monitoring data that are collected often lack a rigorous sample design and sufficient sample size needed to detect temporal changes in abundance and distribution of invasive species, both of which would help managers better prioritize management efforts (Maxwell et al. 2017). The NPS Inventory and Monitoring Program (NPS I&M), which was established in the late 1990s, was founded in part to fill these types of knowledge gaps in national parks (Fancy et al. 2009). The NPS I&M program consists of 32 networks that conduct baseline inventories and long-term monitoring of vital signs in over 270 national parks. In the eastern US, more than 50 national parks are conducting long-term forest monitoring in permanent, randomly located plots (Comiskey et al. 2009a). Now that at least three rounds of monitoring have been conducted in many of these parks, we can examine spatial and temporal trends in invasive plants to determine the species or guilds that pose the greatest threats to park forests to help park managers prioritize invasive management efforts.

In this study, we combine data from the Eastern Forest Working Group that includes over 1400 permanent forest monitoring plots that span 39 national park units from Virginia to Maine to assess status and trends in invasive plants in eastern park forests (Figure 1). The majority of forest plots in this analysis have been sampled 3 times over the last 12 years (2007-2018) using similar methods across networks. Our primary objectives are to identify species or guilds that consistently achieve high abundance across the region and/or that exhibit rapid expansion rates across multiple parks.
