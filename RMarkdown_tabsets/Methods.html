<h3>Field Methods and Study Sites</h3>
Plots are sampled on a 4-year rotating panel, such that one quarter (i.e., one panel) of plots is sampled every year, and each plot is sampled every 4 years. For this analysis we first summarized spatial patterns of invasive species abundance from the most recent cycle of surveys (i.e., 2015-2018). We then conducted a trend analysis of the past three cycles of surveys where cycle 1 represents survey years 2007-2010, cycle 2 represents survey years 2011-2014, and cycle 3 represents survey years 2015-2018.

We calculated three plot-level metrics that represent different scales or processes of invasion: plot frequency, quadrat frequency, and average cover. Plot frequency is the percent of plots with at least one invasive species, and roughly captures the broader spread of invasive species across a park. Quadrat frequency is the percent of quadrats per plot containing at least one invasive species, and tracks the spread of invasive species within a plot. Average cover is the percent cover of invasive species estimated in 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats, averaged across the quadrats in each plot. Average cover more closely tracks changes in abundance of invasive species over time. While average cover and quadrat frequency only included species found in quadrats, plot frequency included all species that were observed within a plot (e.g., invasive vines on trees, invasive shrubs microplots, etc.).

For each of the three invasive metrics, we modeled three grouping levels: total invasives, by guild, and by species. We chose these three grouping levels because they answer different management questions, such as whether overall invasive abundance is declining, or which species are the most abundant in a given park. These grouping levels also have varying power to detect trends based on prevalence of 0s and number of factor levels in the model. In other words, while the species-level analyses are potentially the most informative, the species-level data also have the most 0s. Species-level analyses may therefore be more difficult to detect trends than guild-level and/or total invasive-level analyses. For species that are difficult to consistently identify to species, such as species of exotic bush honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.), and privet (Ligustrum spp.), we calculated invasive metrics at the genus level. For the guild analyses, we grouped species into the following life forms: tree, shrub/vine, herbaceous, and graminoid. Graminoids are grasses, sedges or rushes (Families: Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and Juncaceae). Herbaceous species include all non-woody vascular species that are not graminoids. We separated graminoids from the herbaceous group because they have been found to respond differently to common eastern forest stressors, such as deer overabundance (Rooney 2009). We combined shrubs and woody vines into one guild because they often behave similarly in the understory stratum we sample in quadrats (i.e., ground up to 2 m) and are not always easily classified as shrub or vine (e.g., Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) and multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora) exhibit characteristics of both shrubs and vines). Note that because NCRN does not estimate percent cover of tree species in the quadrats, we could not analyze trends in average cover of invasive trees for that network, although we were able to examine trends in plot frequency and quadrat frequency of invasive trees.

<h3>Statistical Methods</h3>
We used linear mixed effects models, with plot as a random intercept, in the lme4 package (Bates et al. 2015) to assess trends in average cover and quadrat frequency. For the guild and species-level analyses, we only modeled guilds or species that were present in = 10% of the plots in a given park. Several parks, including Antietam National Battlefield (NB, ANTI), Monocacy NB (MONO), and Weir Farm National Historic Site (NHS; WEFA), had more species than number of plots, even after excluding species present in <10% of plots. To ensure we had sufficient degrees of freedom for the species-level analyses, we only included half as many species as there were plots and selected the most abundant species based on plot frequency. Diagnostics (e.g., residual plots) on these models consistently indicated issues with normality and constant variance. While estimates of coefficients (e.g., slope) are robust to violations of non-normal error, significance testing is not (Maas and Hox 2004, Givens and Hoeting 2012). We therefore used case bootstrapping, a non-parametric bootstrap method that resamples plots while maintaining their random structure, to generate empirical 95% confidence intervals of model coefficients based on 1000 samples for each model (Givens and Hoeting 2012). While case bootstrapping relaxes the assumptions of the underlying error distribution, it also requires a sufficient number of plots to sample. We therefore had to exclude Sagamore Hill NHS (SAHI) and Wolf Trap Park for the Performing Arts (WOTR) from the trend analyses because they had too few plots (i.e., < 10 plots) to create a usable sampling distribution to make inference on. For the quadrat-level trend analyses, we interpret effect sizes in original metric units (e.g., actual change in % quadrat frequency over time), rather than percent change over time.

For plot frequency, we used generalized mixed effects models in the lme4 package (Bates et al. 2015) with a binomial distribution (i.e., logistic regression) to determine whether plots were significantly more or less likely to be invaded in subsequent cycles. We modeled each park individually, using a random intercept model with plot as the random factor. For the plot frequency analysis, we only included parks with at least 10% of plots containing an invasive species and no more than 90% of plots containing an invasive species, to avoid convergence issues. To test for significant trends, we used parametric bootstrapping of 1000 samples, which is recommended over case bootstrapping for models with a known error distribution (Givens and Hoeting 2012, Bates et al. 2015). We interpreted effect size for plot frequency as the odds of an invasive occurring in a plot each additional cycle, which we calculated by taking the exponent of the slope coefficient.
